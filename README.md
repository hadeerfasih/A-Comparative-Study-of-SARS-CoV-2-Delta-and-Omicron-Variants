# A-Comparative-Study-of-SARS-CoV-2-Delta-and-Omicron-Variants

## Overview
This project analyzes the genetic differences between the SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron variants. Using sequence alignment, phylogenetic tree construction, and mutation analysis, we identify key variations that impact the virusâ€™s transmissibility and mutation resistance.

## Features
- **Multiple Sequence Alignment:** Aligns genetic sequences to identify conserved and mutated regions.
- **Phylogenetic Tree Construction:** Visualizes evolutionary relationships using the Neighbor-Joining algorithm.
- **Mutation Analysis:** Identifies variant-specific mutations and calculates nucleotide composition.
- **Data Visualization:** Provides graphical representation of mutation density and sequence similarities.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (for data processing and sequence analysis)
- **Biopython** (for sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree generation)
- **Matplotlib** (for data visualization)
- **ClustalW** (for multiple sequence alignment)

## Results
- Generated phylogenetic tree showing the evolutionary relationship between the variants.
- Identified key mutation regions and classified them based on their impact.
- Visualized nucleotide composition differences between Delta and Omicron.
